  <xs:complexType name="CallAnsweredEvent">

      <xs:documentation>
        The Call Answered event is generated when a call originated or received
        by the subscriber is answered.
        For a given call, there may be more than one Call Answered event
        generated. This can happened for instance if an Active call is
        redirected following a Blind Transfer request. In such case, the
        call will go back in Alerting state. Once the transferred
        destination answers the call, a new Call Answered event is
        generated. As a result, a total of two Call Answered events will
        have been received: the first one before the transfer (since the
        call was already in the active state prior to the transfer) and
        the second one after the successful transfer. The answerTime
        captured in the event always indicates the time of the first
        call answer. The call state is Active.

      <xs:documentation>

        The Call Collecting event is generated when BroadWorks needs to collect
        information by interacting with a subscriber. This event
        generated in two types of situation:

        i) When programming a service through a Feature Access Code. This
        happens for instance when a subscriber activates Call Forward
        Always.
        ii)When BroadWorks requires some information before calling the remote
        party. This happens for instance when a subscriber invoke the
        Calling Line ID Blocking service before dialing. This can also
        happen when BroadWorks require an authentication or accounting
        code before calling the remote party. Note that in these cases,
        the Call Collecting event is not generated if the service
        activation precedes the setup of a call and the destination is
        already known from the dialed digits.


        The callId and externalTrackingId is generated when the call is
        established with BroadWorks and included in the event. The call
        state is Active and the personality is originator. The address
        parameter of the remoteParty is set to the dialed digits.

        The Call Originated event is generated when a call is being originated

        1. When the calling subscriber manually initiates a call by dialing a
        destination on its device. In this case a new callId and the
        externalTrackingId are generated by BroadWorks.

        2. When the remote application has initiated a call through a dial
        request. In this case, first a Call Originating event is
        generated when the system has accepted the request. Once the
        subscriber has accepted the dial attempt (by going off-hook),
        then the call personality changes from "Click-to-Dial" to
        "Originator" and a Call Originated event is issued. Both the
        Call Originating and Call Originated event have the same CallId
        and external-tracking-id. In both cases, the call state is
        Alerting and the personality is originator.

        For subscriptions to the Advanced Call 2 event package, the event is

        For subscriptions to the Basic Call event package or the Advanced Call
        event package, the event is generated after service processing.
        If the call is forwarded to a new destination, or rejected
        without alerting the user's device(s) (e.g. do not disturb),
        then the event is not generated.

        This event is also generated in cases where the subscriber is being
        recalled (e.g. call transfer recall). It contains information on
        the caller in the remoteParty parameter.

        The call state is Alerting and the personality is terminator.

        such updates are: remote party information changes, local
        endpoint changes, personality changes. Local endpoint changes
        occurs if for instance a subscriber has multiple access
        endpoints and performs a Call Retrieve from a phone, then the
        AccessEndpoint is expected to be modified. A Personality change
        can occur during a Directed Call Pickup with Barge-in
        As a result, a remote application must inspect the various field of
        the Call Updated event to determine what change occurred since
        the last notification.
