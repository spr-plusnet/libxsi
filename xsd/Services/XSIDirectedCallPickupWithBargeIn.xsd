        User Directed Call Pickup With BargeIn properties. Directed Call Pickup
        with Barge-in allows you
        to dial a feature access code followed by an extension to pick up or
        barge-in on a call to
        another group member. If the call has not been answered, then it is picked
        up. If the call has
        been answered, then barge-in occurs. A barge-in results in a three-way
        call being created
        between you, the group member being barged-in on, and the other party the
        group member is
        connected to. You are the controller of the barge-in three-way call.
